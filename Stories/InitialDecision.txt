Initial decision
I was wrapped in a cocoon of anxiety as I sat in the small room, fingers tapping nervously on
the plastic armrest of the chair. The ticking clock was the only indication that time was
moving forward, yet it felt suspended as I waited for the doctor to deliver news I dreaded but
had somehow sensed was coming.
When Dr. Morris finally entered, ‘Good afternoon’, he began, his voice steady but gentle. In
my mind I had prepared for the worst, after all those worrisome Google searches I did prior to
the meeting. My heart raced, a drumbeat of dread echoing in my ears.
‘I think we should discuss your test results.’
…
I thought back to the years of raising my three children, the rollercoaster of single
parenthood. I could see their tiny faces, wide-eyed with wonder, and hear their laughter
echoing through our cramped apartment. The four of us had fought against the tide of grief
after losing my partner, who had been my rock, my supporter. We fought as a family, as a
team and as friends. Twelve years had passed since that fateful day, yet the ache of loss had
never fully left me.
My life had finally begun to stabilize. The kids were grown, each branching out into the
world; Nick, who had just graduated, just found a job at a corporate’s office. All those years
of sacrifice, sleepless nights, and worry had not been in vain. I had gotten them through it.
Then I had won the lottery. I had developed the habit of buying lottery tickets once in a while
since the passing of my partner. When life was tough and the light at the end of the tunnel
was not to be seen, a dream of luck comforted me a little. It wasn’t an astronomical sum
though, a sum just enough to buy 4 Teslas—the cheapest kind. But it did allow me freedom to
leave the corporate grind behind, and finally step into the life I had always dreamt of having.
Two weeks prior, I had visited the clinic after experiencing a worsening fatigue that draped
over me like a heavy blanket. At first, I attributed it to the emotional and physical toll of
raising my children alone for over a decade. From what I heard from my friends, it is
absolutely normal to be totally exhausted after retirement. Maybe this fatigue was just my
body’s way of asking for a break—a demand years in the making.
…
The doctor leaned forward, paused for a few seconds, and announced the verdict, ‘You have
liver cancer, and it’s an aggressive form. We need to start treatment immediately.
Chemotherapy would be…’
Liver cancer. I had prepared myself for this possibility—it was written on one of the web
pages I had visited. Yet the word echoed in my mind like a cruel joke and I felt my world
falling apart. It was like when my first child was born. We thought we had already prepared
for labour, but when the contractions started it went out of control.
Liver cancer. As if it was the name of a new person. And I will have to live with it side by
side for the next few months. The weight of liver cancer was pressing down on me,
threatening to vacuum out the hope I could finally embraced.
‘What will happen next?’ I asked, my voice betraying a tremor I could not suppress.
He gave me a reassuring nod. ‘We’ll start chemotherapy right away. You’re not alone in this.’
As the weight of his words spread across my mind, I took a deep breath, merging anxiety
with a flicker of determination. Just as I had faced the challenges of raising three children on
my own, perhaps I could confront this battle, too.
I told my kids about it. Allow me to omit the details. I hate to cry while I write. Three months
had passed since I complied with my eldest son, Mark’s, adamant request of moving into my
place. I agreed under the condition that he persuaded the other two to not care about me too
much and focus on their own lives. Christina deserves time with her new husband while Nick
needs to fight for a bright career. Their focus should not be on a feeble old man.
As I laid there during my first round of chemotherapy, I felt nothing—not physically, and
certainly not emotionally. It was as though I was stuck on a train barreling down a trackless
route, lost, with no destination in sight. It seemed absurd that I would retire at 60 and be
content to explore passions I had long shelved, only now to find myself on the brink of what
could be the end, that I’m no longer retiring from work, but retiring from life.
I was encased in the sterile white of the treatment room, IV fluids humming quietly as they
flowed through me. Friends and family tried to convince me that I would emerge from this
stronger, but I knew that I was waving at Death. Death. Perhaps soon another acquaintance,
another friend.
Once you wave at death, however, survival feels so tangible. I felt it deep in my gut as the
clock was dragged forward. It hummed in my fatigued muscles throughout the day. The
chemotherapy promised to eradicate the threat, yet I felt its intrusion into my body. Not only
am I fighting liver cancer, my body where this battle is fought, with soldiers trampling over
my every sinew. When the day for my next doctor’s appointment arrived, I felt that I had
aged ten years.
The muted colors of the clinic had become all too familiar over the past few months. When I
finally sat in the small examination room, waiting for the doctor to deliver news that seemed
to drape over me like a heavy cloak, I felt a growing sense of dread.
Once in the consultation room, I sat opposite Dr. Morris, who shuffled through papers,
occasionally glancing up at me, his face a mask of professionalism. I fidgeted with the hem of
my shirt, waiting for the words that would make the torment I had been suffering worthwhile.
But as Dr. Morris finally spoke, my heart sank.
“I’m afraid the results aren’t what we had hoped for,” he said softly, the disappointment
palpable in his tone and in the air. “The chemotherapy isn’t having the desired effect.” It was
as if God had decided to strip away all the blessings slowly bestowed upon me. I felt
weightless for a moment, as though the world had shifted under me. I had imagined a future
where I would reclaim my life—travel, paint, garden, maybe see my children have kids—but
now those aspirations felt like distant dreams, fading further away.
“What does this mean?” I managed to ask, my voice a whisper caught between denial and
despair.
He explained the next steps, the potential for alternate treatments that lay ahead, but I barely
heard his words. My mind raced. How could this be happening? All those moments of
strength—what had they meant?
‘For your case, a liver transplant can be considered. Yet given the severity of your case, only
a deceased liver will do, and there is only a very slim chance for that. We need other options.
But there is still hope. Let me walk you through the options now.’
I took a deep breath as the doctor continued to weigh the options with me as I scribbled down
some notes on the pad provided, as if words would transform into hope.
‘20% chance of success for the next chemo,’ I muttered to myself, trying to remain calm. I
looked up at Dr. Morris, trying to gauge his confidence in the alternative.
‘And the new drug?’ I asked, already knowing the answer but needing to hear it from him.
‘Well,’ he began, his expression serious, ‘it's still a relatively new treatment, but the results so
far have been promising. In some cases, it's been extremely effective, but we do see instances
where it doesn't work as well. The odds of success, however, are much higher than any of the
traditional chemo treatments, at around 70%’
I felt a glimmer of hope, but it was tempered by the next words out of his mouth.
‘The drawback is the cost, I'm afraid. The new drug is expensive – very, very expensive…’
My mind reeled as I thought about the amount of money he was talking about—my lottery
money, my pension and most of my savings combined. How could I justify spending almost
everything on a gamble for having a life?
A 70% chance of success was much better than the 20% for the next chemo, but what about
the cost? Is it even worth it? If the chemo doesn’t work out and I can’t make it till fall, at least
I would have left quite some money for my kids. They could live their lives without financial
burden.
‘I'm afraid it would be a difficult decision to make, but I want you to know that I support you
either way.’ Dr Morris continued.
I nodded, feeling overwhelmed. I knew I had to make a decision, but it was one of life and
death. Should I risk almost everything I owned for a good chance at living?
