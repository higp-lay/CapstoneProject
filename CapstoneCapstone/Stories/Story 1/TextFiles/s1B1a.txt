My life was almost over after the first round of chemo, and I declined the expensive treatment. It was just so damn pricey that I wouldn’t want my children to worry about money in the future. I love my family, and for that, I continued with the more affordable therapy. It was truly miraculous that I survived; when cancer was about to engulf me, my body found a way to untangle itself. This is why I chose cryonics. I didn’t want my life to end here. In some way, I felt that there were so many adventures left to experience and crossroads I had never made my choice in. I wanted another chance to live, especially since I had enough  money now, and doing cryonics didn’t burden my children. I look forward to living a second life on Earth again, because the first one was too short and I hadn’t enjoyed it to the fullest. Life is so worth celebrating, so why not have another go?
Now, I find myself observing my own funeral, suspended in a state of quiet contemplation. Mark stands at the front, his face a mix of sorrow and confusion, unsure whether to mourn or celebrate my decision. Christina clutches Nick’s hand, her eyes glistening, sharing the same turmoil of emotions swirling within her. They seem to wrestle with the weight of loss while grappling with the hope that my story isn’t truly over. I wish I could comfort them, to assure them that this isn’t an end but merely a pause, a chance for a new beginning. I can’t help but feel a bittersweet sense of peace as I watch them navigate their feelings, knowing that, in a way, I’m still here, waiting for the next chapter.
