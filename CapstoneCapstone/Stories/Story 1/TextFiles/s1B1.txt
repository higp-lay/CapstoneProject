Chapter 3: Eternity

The moment I stepped out of the doctor’s office, a heavy weight suffocated my chest. I chose to continue the fight through more rounds of chemo. I could only imagine how agonizing it would be, but what else would give me a chance of survival? As I walked to the car, the sun felt almost too bright against the backdrop of my dark swirling thoughts.
Back home, I tried to put on a brave face. Mark was at the kitchen table, buried in paperwork, while Christina arrived with my favorite pastries, hoping to lighten the mood. I told them I would keep on fighting. Mark nodded, but I could see the tightness in his jaw, the unspoken fear lurking beneath his unwavering support.
The first week of therapy was brutal. Each session left me feeling more depleted than the last. The nausea returned to haunt me and I spent hours curled up on the couch. I felt guilty for the burden I placed on my family, especially as I watched Christina’s face fall when I pushed the pastries away, knowing they would likely be vomited back up later anyway. But what was the point of indulging in treats that would only end in disappointment?
I stayed mostly at home as the outside world gradually seemed like a distant blur. Sometimes—perhaps often—fighting on felt like the only thing left within me is my will to live, and I wasn’t sure if this struggle was worth it.
Yet, amidst the pain, there were rays of hope: Christina announced she was pregnant. The news brought a momentary lightness to our home, a glimmer of joy that cut through the heaviness of my illness. I told myself, ‘at least I should live to see my grandchild be born. At least I will be on Christina’s side when that happens. At least I will be a grandparent.’
As days turned into weeks, it was time to start the fourth drug. The infusion began. How was I supposed to feel, having tried three drugs that were to no avail? The fourth drug was the most torturous of all, to an extent where I puked so much I had to visit the hospital on one occasion. Despite the agony, I clung to the hope that this would be the turning point. The days following the treatment were a blur of discomfort and despair. I spent hours in and out of sleep, my body protesting every movement. Yet, deep down, I held onto the belief that this pain might lead to something greater.
Finally, the day came for my next appointment with Dr. Morris. I walked into the office–without any sign of strength. My heart was pounding—not just from anxiety, but from the remnants of the drug still coursing through my veins. As I sat across from him, I could see the anticipation in his eyes.
‘Your latest scans are in,’ he began, a slight smile breaking through his usually serious demeanor. ‘I have good news.’
The words hung in the air, and I felt a flicker of hope ignite within me. ‘The fourth drug has been very effective. The tumor has shrunk significantly, and it is now operable.’
I still vividly remember that moment, which was more delighting than winning the lottery, literally. I could hardly process what he was saying. The pain I had endured suddenly felt like a necessary sacrifice. Tears of relief and joy welled up in my eyes. I had fought through the worst of it, and now I had a chance—a real chance.
‘Yes, sweetheart,’ I replied Christina, trying to sound reassuring. ‘This surgery is the last step.’
‘But what if something goes wrong?’ Nick chimed in, his voice trembling. ‘What if you…?’
‘I'll be in good hands, I promise. The doctors are skilled at what they do.’ I sensed a whirlwind of emotions within them, akin to a player on the verge of winning a tiebreaker in a sports match—completely focused, caught between joy and fear, holding their breath until the outcome was 100% certain.
The surgery went well, and with each passing day, I felt stronger. Yet, beneath that gratitude lay an undercurrent of anxiety. The reality of our finances was stark; we had just enough to get by, but not much more. I worried about how we would manage in the long run. Would I ever reclaim the stability we once briefly had?
I was oscillating between hope and fear after recovery. Having little savings while approaching the age of 60 filled me with trepidation. I wanted to be present for my children, to guide them through life’s challenges, but I feared what my illness had already cost us.

Ten years later…
On a brisk autumn afternoon, ten years after my surgery, the world was abuzz with shocking news: a beloved celebrity had recently passed away, but his ‘ostensible’ death ignited a firestorm of conversation. This star, known for his lifelong passion and advocacy for life extension, had signed up for cryonics prior to his passing. His decision to be cryopreserved after death became a focal point for media outlets and social media platforms alike.
The discourse echoed in my mind, compelling me to reflect on my own journey. At 68, it was difficult to be unaware of life’s fragility. The celebrity’s decision led to a train of thoughts within me. Ever since my partner passed away, leaving me with the three kids, life had always been tough. I faced the financial struggles throughout the years to raise them all in that small apartment, as well as stress from my day job. Then my two-year battle with cancer just after winning the lottery. And when I had finally recovered from cancer, I realised time and youth had flown on the wings of those bygone years. And, there was so much that I had not experienced yet. But I knew time was running short, and my stamina was declining.
Many people recover completely from cancer, but for me, I felt that a part of me was permanently damaged by it. No longer could I stay up until 11 at night, and no longer could I physically manage a day job Monday to Friday. Nearing my 70, I could feel that death was probably only a few years away. I could not put my finger on it, but I simply knew.
As I sat in my sunlit living room, I listened to the news anchor’s voice, which was both somber and puzzling at the same time. The celebrity’s story was not just about his untimely death; it was about his belief in the possibility of a future where he could be revived, where advancements in science could offer him a second chance at life. Interviews flooded in with fans, scientists, and ethicists discussing his unorthodox choice to his own ‘death’, some praising his open-mindedness while others had serious doubts.
I wondered what would happen if I were cryopreserved. Then, somehow, I thought of the life I have waking up a hundred years later. Until my thoughts went adrift and my eyes hid under my eyelids in the night.

DECISION:
A. Agrees to cryonics
B. Declines cryonics
