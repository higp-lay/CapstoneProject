My life ended with strength. It was short—perhaps shorter than it might have been. For two years, or maybe more, I endured the inferno of malignancy. My family and I lived in a pain that escalated daily. It felt futile to continue; I sensed my soul slowly slipping away, and no medication could change that. Life should end, and I wished for it to conclude with dignity and strength. Some people might argue that I should prolong life for as long as I can, but what makes the opportunity to live outweigh all suffering in that moment?
Some might also ask if I regret my decisions. Honestly, I find peace in them. If I had chosen that expensive therapy, who knows if I would have been gone in two years anyway? I didn’t want to leave my children burdened by financial strain. We shouldn’t regret choices based solely on negative outcomes; rather, we should regret when we don’t feel what we hoped for. I envisioned financial stability for my family, a pause in my suffering, and the ability to end my life on my terms with strength. And I achieved all three.
