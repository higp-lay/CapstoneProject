My life? I chose to donate a fortune to a cancer fund. Don’t mistake me for a savior; this money might only help save one child with that damn expensive treatment. But I could do it, so why not? My family has what they need, though I won’t pretend that their lives are free from worry and hardship. In the end, those kids suffering from cancer need the funds more than my family does. I’ve endured rounds of chemo, feeling like I was spiraling down into a futureless abyss. And how much is a future worth to a young person? It’s priceless.
I know my time is limited after all I’ve endured, I feel it in my every breath. I'll probably go on a retreat when I'm about to die, to a remote place away from it all. I won’t bring my children; I don’t want them to witness my pain and suffering at the end of my journey. I don’t want them to spend their time and energy trying to extend a life that feels nearly over. I’ve struggled long enough for life, and if my time is near, I will embrace it willingly.
I’ll spend my days writing about my thoughts on life and death, contemplating their meaning. Perhaps my dear children will read these reflections after I’m gone. Don’t see this as a sad farewell; it’s a celebration of living. I understand better than anyone that death is near and that life is fleeting. And—what’s more—that’s what makes life magical.
