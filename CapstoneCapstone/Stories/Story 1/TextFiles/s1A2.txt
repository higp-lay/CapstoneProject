Chapter 3: Identity

After much thought and seeing the increasing worries on my family’s faces, I made the difficult decision to forgo the kidney donation. Yet, every time I thought of the people on the long waiting list, a subtle feeling of guilt crept in. I couldn’t entirely quell my urge to contribute.
Therefore, immediately after deciding not to proceed with living donation, I signed up for posthumous organ donation. It seemed a fitting compromise, a way to extend my compassion beyond my lifetime. My family gladly agreed, understanding my desire to help others even when I was no longer here. Yet, the shadow of guilt lingered, a quiet reminder of the sacrifice I had chosen to forgo…

For the next five years, I lived a peaceful life and I found joy in simple moments—a walk in the park, laughter around the dinner table, and quiet evenings with a good old book. During this time, I also became involved in community activities, advocating for organ donation and sharing my own story with those around me. Each day brought new reflections on my choices and their implications, deepening my appreciation for the time I had with my loved ones. And as day passed by and I grew old, I started to contemplate death once again. Death. My old friend.
It was during one of these quiet moments that I stumbled upon an intriguing opportunity. A leading research institution was seeking elderly volunteers to have their stem cells extracted, with the hope that one day, when technology advanced, these cells could be used to grow a new person with their DNA. With their pioneering research, they were confident that such things would be possible in less than 20 years.
I took a leaflet from the community centre and studied it back at home. It felt interesting the more I thought about it. Not the extraction itself, but how it made me feel.
The procedure was harmless and low-cost, but the idea that someone could potentially be grown from my cells in the future filled me with a peculiar mix of emotions. It’s a wonderfully simple procedure like blood-taking—which I’m no stranger to. Yet as a consequence, some years down the line, there might be a clone of me on the planet. The strong juxtaposition stirred up emotions within me, ones that I could merely describe as unusually exciting while frightening. Would they be a continuation of me, or simply a separate entity with my genetic material?
Who would I be, if I am not unique?
What would death mean, if a few cells are kept alive?

DECISION:
A. Agree to stem cell extraction
B. Refuses stem cell extraction
