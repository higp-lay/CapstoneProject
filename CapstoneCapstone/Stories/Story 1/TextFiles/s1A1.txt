Chapter 3: Our values

I blinked awake, the harsh fluorescent lights above stinging my eyes. My body felt heavy, as if weighed down by an invisible force. Slowly, I became aware of the soft beeping of machines, the gentle rustle of fabric nearby, and that I just underwent surgery. As my vision cleared, I saw my children gathered around me: Mark, Christina, and Nick. Their faces were drawn, eyes wide with anxiety.
‘Can you hear me?’ Mark’s voice quivered, a mix of relief and overwhelming worry. I tried to nod, but pain shot through my abdomen, forcing a groan from my lips.
‘Take it slow,’ Christina urged, her voice trembling as she reached for my hand. Her grip was tight, and I could see the tears pooling in her eyes. ‘You’re in recovery. You had some complications, but you’re going to be okay.’
‘Con-phi-cations?’ I managed to murmur, my throat dry like the Sahara.
Nick leaned closer, his expression a mixture of fear and desperation. ‘You developed a post-surgical infection. We didn’t know what to expect…’
The depth of their anxiety wrapped around me like a heavy shroud. I could feel the tension radiating from them, the way they exchanged worried glances, their bodies coiled tight with concern. It was as if their fears were a palpable force in the room. But I was relieved because I was breathing. I was alive.


A few days later, I was finally able to sit up. I felt a mix of nervousness and anticipation as I prepared to meet Flynn, the man who had received my kidney.
Flynn was in his late forties, with salt-and-pepper hair and warm, expressive eyes that seemed to have carried a lot.
‘Hi there,’ he said, his voice steady despite the circumstances. ‘I’m Flynn.’
‘Hi, I’m—well, I guess you know who I am,’ I replied, a smile breaking through my unease.
We settled into a conversation as Flynn shared his story about him battling with renal failure. I shared mine being a single parent, fighting cancer—using up pretty much all my money, getting old.
‘I never thought I’d have a new chance at life,’ he said, his voice breaking slightly.
The gravity of what I had done settled in my heart. ‘I wanted to help. It’s incredible to hear how much this means to you.’
 ‘I’m actually a reporter,’ he said, a hint of pride in his voice. ‘I’ve covered stories about organ donation and the impact it has on families for years. But experiencing it from this side… it’s a whole different world. Perhaps I should write about my experience too, man.’ He joked, shaking his head.
Once he finished, I felt a surge of connection and knew it was time to share my own story. ‘I can relate to the uncertainty you felt,’ I began, taking a deep breath. ‘I’m a single parent, and I faced my own battle with cancer. I underwent countless rounds of chemotherapy and had to make tough decisions about expensive medications. Somehow, I survived miraculously.’
‘It wasn’t easy. Life after the treatment has been difficult; I still struggle with the side effects of the drugs and the emotional toll it took on me. There were days when I felt completely defeated, but my children kept me going. After everything I went through, donating my kidney felt like a way to pay it forward. I wanted to give someone else the chance to experience life, just as I had been given.’
‘You know what, let me write about you, mate,’ he urged. ‘Not just the donation, but your whole journey. I believe it will resonate with so many people.’
I hesitated. ‘Me? I thought you said you’re gonna write about your journey. I’m just an ordinary old dude you know.’
‘Exactly,’ Flynn said, his eyes sparkling with sincerity. ‘Ordinary people can do extraordinary things. Your story needs to be told.’
‘Should you wait until you have recovered?’ I chuckled as he firmly shook his head.
As I prepared to discharge from the hospital, I felt a renewed sense of purpose. Flynn promised to keep in touch, and as he left, I couldn’t shake the feeling that our paths had crossed for a reason. And that a part of my abdomen emptied, a part of me was fulfilled to have helped.
In the following weeks, as Flynn’s article gained traction, I was overwhelmed by people reaching out with their heartfelt gratitude and admiration. Amidst the discourse, a fundraiser was organized in my honor, aimed at helping those who faced similar struggles. The total sum was staggering after a week–I guess that's the power of social media…
